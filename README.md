# Advent of Code 2018 Challenge

Giving the [Advent of Code 2018 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about) a shot. Nothing super advanced or fancy here — just trying to get in some JS practice and hopefully learn a few new things along the way.

Each day has a folder with the js file (`(day number).js`), my input as a txt file (`(day number)-input.txt`), and a `README.md` with the day's puzzle text.

`_blank/` can be copied to help quickly create starter files for a new day. 

Using Node.js (8.12). 

Calling any day's js file (e.g. `$ node 01/01.js`) via command line should get the relevant input and spit out the solutions.
